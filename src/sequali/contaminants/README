This folder contains sequences that are often found as contaminants in
sequencing experiments. According to the NCBI the most common contaminations
are:
- Vector DNA (plasmid, phage, BAC, etc.)
- Adapters, linkers and PCR primers
Other sources of contaminations are:
- Transposons and insertion sequences
- DNA impurities

NCBI keeps a database called UniVec for vectors and updated. It was last
updated on November 21st 2023. It can be downloaded from:
https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/UniVec

The UniVec database contains many adapters, linkers, and primers but not yet
a lot of those that are used in Oxford nanopore sequencing. As of 2023
some nanopore Adapters have been added. The
oxford_nanopore.fasta file provides the sequences as represented in the
technical documentation. All possible barcoding sequencing adapters for
nanopore have not yet been added.

Oxford Nanopore adapter and barcode sequences as listed in the
technical documentation are included in oxford_nanopore.fasta and
oxford_nanopore_barcodes.fasta.

Illumina adapter trimming sequences are included in
illumina.fasta. These sequences are common among
a variety of commercially provided adapters. To prevent a false positive ID
on the commercially provided adapters when only a part of the common sequence
is found these sequences had to be added.


Common human genome repeats were added on the basis of the tandem repeat
database: https://tandem-test.bu.edu/cgi-bin/trdb/trdby.exe.
